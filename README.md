 - When the user chooses a drink, it will check if there are currently enough ingredients/resources needed to make the coffee.
 - If there are sufficient resources, it will tell the user the cost of the drink and to Insert Coins.
 - Then it will check the total paid by user and see if change is needed.
 - If the user did not put in enough money, it will let the user know and refund the money.
